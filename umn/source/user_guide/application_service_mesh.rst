Application Service Mesh
========================

Application Service Mesh (ASM) is a service mesh platform developed based on Istio. It seamlessly interconnects with Cloud Container Engine (CCE), an enterprise-level Kubernetes cluster service. With better usability, reliability, and visualization, ASM provides you with out-of-the-box features and enhanced user experience.

ASM is a non-intrusive microservice governance solution that provides full-lifecycle management and traffic management. It is compatible with the Kubernetes and Istio ecosystems and provides a wide range of features such as load balancing, outlier detection, and rate limiting. ASM provides diversified built-in grayscale releases, including canary release and blue-green deployment, enabling one-stop automatic release management.
