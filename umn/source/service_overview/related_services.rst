Cloud Container Engine (CCE)
----------------------------

Cloud Container Engine (CCE) is a high-performance, high-reliability service through which enterprises can manage containerized applications. CCE supports native Kubernetes applications and tools, allowing you to easily set up a container runtime environment on the cloud.

You can enable the service mesh function for CCE clusters to manage the services in the clusters.

Elastic Load Balance (ELB)
--------------------------

ELB automatically distributes access traffic to multiple cloud servers to balance the loads. It enhances an application's fault tolerance and service continuity.

You can use ELB to access ASM from outside.

Application Performance Management (APM)
----------------------------------------

Application Performance Management (APM) monitors and manages the performance of cloud applications in real time. APM provides performance analysis of distributed applications, helping O&M personnel quickly locate and resolve faults and performance bottlenecks.

You can use APM to manage trace topologies of all the services in service meshes and traces in distributed systems. It can help you quickly locate faults and analyze root causes.
