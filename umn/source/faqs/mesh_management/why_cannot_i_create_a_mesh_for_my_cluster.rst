Why Cannot I Create a Mesh for My Cluster?
==========================================

Symptom
-------

I cannot create a mesh for my cluster.

Analysis
--------

Currently, clusters of versions earlier than 1.15 cannot be managed by meshes.

Solution
--------

#. Check the cluster version. Currently, only clusters of v1.15, v1.17, or v1.19 can be managed by meshes.
#. Check your browser. Chrome is recommended. The button for mesh creation may be unavailable when you are using other browsers, such as Firefox, due to adaptation problems.
